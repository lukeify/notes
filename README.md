# Notes

I find writing is a good way of summarising my understanding of topics, and when I inevitably do forget something, having a series of bulleted notes is often the quickest way to regain the context about something. Sometimes this can also consist of a series of steps I have written for doing takss that I need infrequently enough that I don't ever properly memorise them.
