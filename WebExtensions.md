# WebExtensions

Caveats and idiosyncrasies of WebExtension APIs and their varying levels of browser support.

## Manifest v3

### `declarativeNetRequest`

Instead of procedurally blocking or modifying requests and responses, requires developers to implement a "rules" DSL on how requests should be blocked by the browser.
Each rule consists of four properties, one of which is optional:

-   `id`
-   `priority` (optional). If not provided, `priority` will equal `1`.
-   `condition`, an object containing predicate(s) the browser will evaluate.
-   `action`, the response to take if the condition yields true, an object where the `type` property is either `block` or `modifyHeaders`.

These rules are packaged into "rulesets".
These rulesets can be either:

* **static**, i.e. packaged with the web extension.
* **dynamic**, provided by the user, or packaged with the web extension and updatable via `updateDynamicRules`.
* **session** rulesets, that do not persist across browser sessions.

#### [`declarativeNetRequest.updateStaticRules`][1]

Allows a web extension to enable or disable individual static rules, which could be useful to allow a user to toggle pre-provided rules according to their preferences.
Supposedly implemented in Chrome 111 (associated GitHub ticket), with [chromium tests here][2].
However, doesn't actually appear to work in the real-worldâ€”static rules that are disabled via this method call continue to be registered with the `declarativeNetRequest` API and continue to work.
Programmatically though, the API seems to function correctly to the point where the unit tests implemented in Chromium obviously pass.

Not implemented in Safari ([WebKit ticket][3]) or Firefox.

#### `declarativeNetRequest.updateEnabledRulesets`

A workaround is instead of updating rules, just have one rule per ruleset and use the actually functional (in Chrome) at least `updateEnabledRulesets` instead of static rules.

#### Regular expression limitations

DNR matches conform to one of three types. One of these is `regexFilter`, but there is no syntax described in the specification for what functionality is available to regexes, as outlined in this [GitHub issue][4]:
Some notes on this with respect to Chrome's support:

> In Chrome, regexpFilter is basically the syntax of the underlying RE2 library plus the additional implementation-dependent constraint that the memory usage of an individual regex may not exceed 2kb

However, Safari `regexFilter` syntax is much more limited, as [described here][5].
One important missing piece of functionality is OR expressions, i.e. `(gallery|poll)` to match the strings `gallery` or `poll` respectively.
Practically, this means this rule must be split into two separate rules.

`regexFilter` is not supported in Firefox yet.
The next most fully-featured alternative is `urlFilter` syntax.

### `storage`

Defines an API where data can be persisted for a web extension.
There are a few `StorageArea`'s for manifest v3 web extensions, one of which is [`storage.local`][6].
One of the methods of each `StorageArea` is `get`, which accepts a `keys` argument (either a single string, or an array of strings) defining the keys to retrieve persisted data for.
Providing `null` is defined in the spec as returning the entire storage contents.

Unfortunately, Safari (both macOS and iOS) [does not support this functionality][7], so you must manually store all keys and provide that as an array to retrieve all contents.
