# Debian

Goal of debian is to provide a highly stable, "free" operating system (the user is however able to install non-free components).
[Debian provides their own definition of "free"][1], which seems mostly compatible with the [GNU definition of "free"][2].
]Debian provides its own list of reasons to use][3].

`bookworm` is the current release ("stable")â€”also called Debian 12, which was released on 10 June 2023.
The latest point release from `bookworm` is Debian 12.6, released on 29 June 2024.
`trixie` is the next release ("testing"), and will be Debian 13.
It does not yet have a scheduled release date.
Packages that have been backported from `trixie` to `bookworm` are available on what's referred to as "backports", which can be added as a separate package source in `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

Being a highly stable OS, many newly-released devices with new chipsets or internal products may be "too new" to run Debian stable without modification.
This happens to be the case with the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (12th gen) laptop.

## Debian-Kernel package matrix

Debian 12 currently ships with Linux Kernel 6.1.99 (`linux-image-6.1.99-amd64`).
Debian 12 `backports` contains Linux Kernel 6.9.7 (`linux-image-6.9.7+bpo-amd64`). https://packages.debian.org/source/bookworm-backports/linux-signed-amd64
Debian `trixie` contains Linux Kernel 6.9.12 (`linux-image-6.9.12-amd64`). https://packages.debian.org/source/trixie/linux-signed-amd64

### CD/DVD Images

These images are a metaphor for when users would literally insert a CD or DVD into their optical disk to boot and install Debian, and as such are capacity-limited to those storage mediums.
The DVD images usually contain enough packages for

## GNOME vs XFCE?

Desktop environments.
Both can be installed simultaneously.

## Goal: Run Debian 12 on a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (12th gen)

This laptop is too new to run Debian 12 vanilla in an acceptable way without modification.
Some of the issues encountered:

* The kernel was not up to date enough, and `6.9` is needed (Intel docs suggest `6.10` is needed?)
* Firmware to use the Wi-Fi 6E AX211 card was not present (and was asking for microcode files), so installing `firmware-iwlwifi` at version `20240709` was needed.
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/204837/intel-wifi-6e-ax211-gig/specifications.html
* No sound was available, as an update to `firmware-sof-signed` to `xxx` was needed.

Remember to install linux headers!

```
sudo apt -t bookworm-backports install linux-headers-amd64
```

#### Kernel (`linux-image-6.9.7+bpo-amd64`)

#### Intel WiFi Microcode (`firmware-iwlwifi_20240709-1`)

Maybe not needed if kernel update is provided?

#### Sof-sound (`firmware-sof-signed_`)

### Kernel Support

### Kernel Modules

Tools:

* modprobe
* lsmod
* insmod
* rmmod

#### `tirdad` stuff
I had to symlink in the linux-headers directory into `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build` as well?

```
ln -sf /usr/lib/$(uname -r)/* /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
```

Once built, install via:

```
install -D -m 644 tirdad.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/tirdad.ko
depmod -a $(uname -r)
```

then verify the module exists:

```
modprobe tirdad
```

insmod tirdad gives a segmentation fault at `cet.c`

Maybe try setting ibt=off?

##### `xfce4` configuration

Configuring XFCE4 window appearance:

Copy files into `config/includes.chroot` into the right subdirectory from there.
