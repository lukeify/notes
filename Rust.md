## Ownership

[Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html) involves managing accessing, cleaning up, and tracking data stored in the heap.
Rules of ownership:

* Each value has an owner.
* Only one owner allowed simultaneously.
* Owner goes out of scope = value is dropped.

```rust
{
    let s = String::from("hello."); // s is valid from this point forward
}
```

At the end of the scope, denoted by the braces, `s` is no longer valid and is deallocated from the heap, as Rust internally calls [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop).
This can also be seen with heap-allocated variables being duplicated (only one owner allowed).

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello.");
let s2 = s1;
```

In this scenario s1 and s2 both are values that contain a pointer to the _same address in memory_ for the heap-stored data.

When `s2` is assigned, `s1` becomes invalid because if both were to go out of scope simultaneously, they will both be freed from memory simultaneouslyâ€”despite pointing to only one location in memory.
This is known as a _double free error_ and rust prevents this.

Thus, Rust nearly always _shallow copies_ data, also known in Rust terms as a "move". The underlying data on the heap is not touched, only the pointer and metadata to it.
To perform what would be called a _deep copy_ in Rust, the `clone` method exists:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
```

Both `s1` and `s2` are valid at the end of this code example.

## `Copy` trait

## Strings

**`String`** is a dynamic vector of bytes (`Vec<u8>`) and is heap-allocated, growable, UTF-8 encoded, and not [null-terminated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-terminated_string).
It is an _owned type_ (as it owns the underlying bytes representing the string) and is frankly the easiest to understand data type here.
It consists of a pointer to the string on the heap, its length, and its capacity.
It can be [defined](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/string.rs.html#365-367) at a high level as:

```rust
pub struct String {
    vec: Vec<u8>
}
```

(With an addition that the bytes of the `vec` are guaranteed to be valid UTF-8).

**`&str`** is a _string slice_, also known as a "view into a string".
It consists of a pointer to the string, and the string length, offering a view into a string.
It is called a _borrowed type_, because it doesn't own the underlying data, and are immutable (and is therefore not growable).

```rust
let my_string: String = String::from("Hello!":);
let my_string_slice: &str = &my_string;
```

The pointer can point to _either_ data on the heap, data in the compiled binary (in the case of string literals), or on the stack.

The string slice is made up of two parts:

* The `str` type. This cannot be used directly because its size is not known at compile time.
* The reference operator (`&`). We use this to get a pointer to the bytes of the string and its length.

A **string literal** is a `&str` that is stored within the compiled binary itself:

```rust
let my_string_literal = "Hello, world!"; // Type is `&str`, which is syntactic sugar for `&'static str`.
```

When declared like this, they are hardcoded into the final executable as they are known at compile-time.
String literals have a "static lifetime", which is to say their lifetime persists for the duration of the program execution.

## Pointers

Types:

* "Reference"

## `Box`

`Box` data types are pointers that store data in the heap.

## `dyn` keyword

If instead of returning a known concrete object, a function returns a `trait`; then the size of the object cannot be known at compile-time; as even though each concrete implementation will adhere to the trait, the object size will differ.

Thus, the return type is said to be "dynamic", and the `dyn` keyword is needed to prefix the trait name in the return type
([before Edition 2021 though, this keyword could be omitted](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/trait-object.html)).
Additionally, this will be wrapped in a `Box` to heap-allocate it.
Thus, the return type is actually a pointer reference to memory on the heap.

```rust
fn get_random_traitable() -> Box<dyn MyTrait> {
    // ...
}
```
